- Have fun exploring Billi!
- I don't own like 99% of the assets in this game, don't sue me pls (i wrote all the code tho iirc)
- Web version and Mobile version have animation removed.
- Web version is kinda laggy, kinda my fault tho i used python.
- This is game jam code so it is rushed and terrible, although thats not really an excuse for versions above 1.0.0 after the game jam i just rushed the other updates because some people were asking for an update and i didnt really want to spend more time using python.
- Web version available on [itch.io](https://gooberwaresandfishes.itch.io/billi)
